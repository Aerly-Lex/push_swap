# push_swap
This project requires you to sort a random amount of numbers to be sorted in the right order by using only 2 stacks and with the least amount of movements. The allowed movements were specified:

* sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
* sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
* ss : sa and sb at the same time.
* pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
* pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
* ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. First becomes last.
* rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. First becomes last.
* rr : ra and rb at the same time.
* rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. Last becomes first.
* rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. Last becomes first.
* rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.

I've used a simple Algorithm called K-Sort.

(Thanks Azer for showing me such a simple and effective solution - [Azer Github-Profile](https://github.com/AzerSD))
